= Creating a Relationship
:type: challenge
:order: 4
:sandbox: true

We want to make another addition to the graph.

Use the sandbox window to the right to add a new node and relationship to the graph:

. Find the _Person_ node for  [copy]#Daniel Kaluuya#.
. Create the _Movie_ node, [copy]#Get Out#.
. Add the [copy]#ACTED_IN# relationship between _Daniel Kaluuya_ and the movie, _Get Out_.

[TIP]
--
You will do a MATCH to find the person.
Then you will do a MERGE to create the movie node.
Remember that our other _Movie_ nodes contain a property called _title_.
Then you will do a MERGE to create the relationship.
